        <hr>
        <h2 id="0.0"><span title="Commit ID was lost!">0.0</span></h2>
        <p>&emsp;The very first version of the site, when the header was ASCII, with a background image that was taking about 20 seconds to load… This version was initiated in <span title="May 17">2020</span>.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2 id="1.0"><span title="Commit 32dbd0d">1.0</span></h2>
        <p>&emsp;The new look of the site, dark, with font <a href="/about#this-font">Future Menu Brown</a>.</p>
        <h3 id="1.1">&emsp;<span title="Commit f010e98">1.1</span></h3>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;New header was set on all pages.</p>
        <h3 id="1.2">&emsp;<span title="Commit 148e761">1.2</span></h3>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Animated backgrounds were added, with different image for each page.</p>
        <h3 id="1.3">&emsp;<span title="Commit 62959c7">1.3</span></h3>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Spolight image and page were created.</p>
        <h3 id="1.4">&emsp;<span title="Commit 10de064">1.4</span></h3>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Images and videos in Home page that have been here since the beginning of the website, were put in Image and Video pages.<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;SVG header was changed, using <code>stroke</code> instead of <code>fill</code>, and with a <span title="0 0 320 50"><code>viewBox</code> size</span> that makes sense. Intro animations were also added, with a <span title="1.4+766">drawing one</span> for the header.</p>
