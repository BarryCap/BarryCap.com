        ‘Who are you?’—The being asks.<br>
        ‘Where do you come from?’<br>
        You are truly shocked by the way the being talks to you.<br>
        Her voice was incredibly… human.<br>
        First, you thought that it came from somewhere else,<br>
        but a quick look around made you realize that you were all alone.<br>
        ‘Hello?’—You say, with a very shy voice.<br>
        ‘You don’t know who you are, isn’t that right?’—She tells you.
