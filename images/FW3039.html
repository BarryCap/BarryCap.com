         An artwork I made using
        <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>
        (for the 3D FW logo and the background) and
        <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>
        (for the colors). The image was made for
        <a href="https://absoww.bandcamp.com/track/compromettre-son-me">a FireWater music</a>
        which was originally named ‘ACID’ (it was realised on
        <a href="https://absoww.bandcamp.com/">ABSOWW</a>
        under the name ‘Compromêtre son Âme’).
        <br />
         The FireWater logo is presented in 3D to show the perspective of the sounds, the depth of
        the stereo effects, the deepness of the concept of a Goa Trance song inspired by the works
        of Infected Mushroom, by interviews of Michel Legrand about the sense of music, by the
        oriental machine which expends in aim of taking all over the musical concept of this track.
        The bright and wavy colors of this picture try to depict an idea of delirium which takes
        place in both artworks.
