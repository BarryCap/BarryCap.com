        &emsp;An artwork I made using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> (for the 3D FW logo and the background) and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> (for the colors). The image was made for a <a target="_blank" href="https://fire-water.bandcamp.com/">FireWater</a> music which was originally named ‘ACID’ (it was realised on <a target="_blank" href="https://absoww.bandcamp.com/">ABSOWW</a> under the name ‘<a target="_blank" href="https://absoww.bandcamp.com/track/compromettre-son-me">Compromettre son Âme</a>’). This picture is part of the series <i>FW----</i>.
        <br>
        &emsp;The <a target="_blank" href="https://fire-water.bandcamp.com/">FireWater</a>
        logo is presented in 3D to show the perspective of the sounds, the depth of the stereo
        effects, the deepness of the concept of a Goa Trance song inspired by the works of Infected
        Mushroom, by interviews of Michel Legrand about the sense of music, by the oriental machine
        which expends in aim of taking all over the musical concept of this track. The bright and
        wavy colors of this picture try to depict an idea of delirium which takes place in both
        artworks.
