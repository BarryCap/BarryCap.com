        &emsp;A picture I made with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> using effects from <a target="_blank" href="https://gmic.eu/">G'MIC</a>.<br>
        &emsp;A few days ago, I dreamed (not really) of a strange piano, stretching to the infinity (maybe I played too much…).<br>
        <br>
        &emsp;I was in this immense room with this piano. I couldn’t see the beginning nor the end of it, I had no landmark. When I looked at the instrument closer, I noticed the keys weren’t exactly right shaped compared to a standard piano. I pushed a key, and I didn’t hear anything, then I pushed very hard many keys at the same time, and nothing. I thought I was in the treble part, and that I couldn’t hear the sounds because they were too high. So I ran to the left, I ran about a minute, and when I was exhausted, I pushed a key. And it was… very high. So I began my glissando. Running and playing at the same time, I’ve never done that. At least not over such a long period.<br>
        &emsp;After a long time, I found the ‘regular’ piano part. And I played very long.
