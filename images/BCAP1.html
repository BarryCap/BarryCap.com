         A BCAP image I made on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>. The unique vanishing point in the middle guides the watcher's eye to these four heavy
        letters, in bold black – which are somehow floating in this greyscale 3D infinite corridor
        (or infinite hole). This is 2000×2000 pixel art, and this justify there's no anti-aliasing.
        <br/>
         All of this work was made to remember those video games (wich sometime have a good
        resolution, but are still pixaled – like the NES which has the same resolution, 240p, than
        the 3DS) and those old – generally fake – perspectives (perspectives which are hand made,
        not using a 3D motor). It is these concepts that I wanted to talk about with BCAP1. BCAP1.
        The name is evocative because it brings to the mind an idea of continuation, an idea of an
        incomplete work – even if, in real, it does not have any, and it is not (respectively).
