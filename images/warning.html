        &emsp;A picture I made for <a target="_blank" href="https://absoww.bandcamp.com/album/warning">a mini-album by FireWater</a>. I modeled the box and the sign in 3D and I recolored it to remove the shadows and give it the right color. The exclamation mark and the stripes pattern were made in vector and added to the models as textures.<br>
        &emsp;The idea was to show the work-in-progress aspect of the mini-album by giving it this warning aspect and color. I think I was inspired by something at the television, the minimalist 3D feel instantly inspired me, and I think I’ll try to make other pictures like this in the future.
