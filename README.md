This is [Barry Cap](https://barrycap.com/about)'s website.<br>
I develop this site since 2020 using mostly HTML and CSS.<br>
Current version: `1.5+787`.<br>

### [About](https://barrycap.com/about)
&emsp;That's about me, the site and the font. It's also the place where you can [contact](mailto:contact@barrycap.com) me.

---
### [Random](https://barrycap.com/random)
&emsp;Random. The name isn't explicit enough? It's all random. Even the background animation. It's researches I made, things I wanted to talk about…

---
### [Spotlight](https://barrycap.com/spotlight)
&emsp;This part gathers all the spolighted pictures. The aim of the Spolight is to bring one picture on top of the site, to make it more alive.
